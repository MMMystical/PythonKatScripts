## WARNING: This script is discontinued. Over the last few months, Roblox has made the moderation system more and more harsh, to the point almost any bypass is impossible. More than 90% of the bypasses here are probably fixed, but if you still want to try go ahead.

### Bypass the chat moderation and say anything you want (almost) in the chat by just clicking the bypass options on the script.

## Features
### Ton of bypasses üìÉ
  - Normal insults
  - Sentences with insults
  - Roleplay bypasses
### Undetectable bypasses üî∞
  - The messages bypass the chat log so you can't get banned for this (unless you probably spam a lot)
### Working bypasses ‚úÖ
  - All bypasses on the script work and don't tag (after you use certain bypasses some will start to tag, but it's normal)
### Funny bypasses ü§´
  - The "sentences" tab usually has some funny bypasses too (but there are some offensive ones as well)
