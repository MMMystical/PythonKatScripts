Here's all the scripts made by PythonKat.

# Chat Bypasser v1.4

Bypass the chat moderation and say anything you want (almost) in the chat by just clicking the bypass options on the script.

### Features
- Ton of bypasses 📃
  - Normal insults
  - Sentences with insults
  - Roleplay bypasses
- Undetectable bypasses 🔰
  - The messages bypass the chat log so you can't get banned for this (unless you probably spam a lot)
- Working bypasses ✅
  - All bypasses on the script work and don't tag (after you use certain bypasses some will start to tag, but it's normal)
- Funny bypasses 🤫
  - The "sentences" tab usually has some funny bypasses too (but there are some offensive ones too)

### Prerequisites
- 13+ account ❕
  - Some bypasses might tag on accounts under 13.

### Notes
- This script only works in games that use the old chat as the new one doesn't have some things the old chat uses that are required to send the messages. ❕
