Here's all the scripts made by PythonKat.

# Chat Bypasser v2.0 ☀️⛱️ (DISCONTINUED, 05/07/2024)

## WARNING: This script is discontinued. Over the last few months, Roblox has made the moderation system more and more harsh, to the point almost any bypass is impossible. More than 90% of the bypasses here are probably fixed, but if you still want to try go ahead.

Bypass the chat moderation and say anything you want (almost) in the chat by just clicking the bypass options on the script.

### Features
- Ton of bypasses 📃
  - Normal insults
  - Sentences with insults
  - Roleplay bypasses
- Undetectable bypasses 🔰
  - The messages bypass the chat log so you can't get banned for this (unless you probably spam a lot)
- Working bypasses ✅
  - All bypasses on the script work and don't tag (after you use certain bypasses some will start to tag, but it's normal)
- Funny bypasses 🤫
  - The "sentences" tab usually has some funny bypasses too (but there are some offensive ones as well)

### Notes
- If you want all bypasses to work it's recommended to have a 13+ account, but you can use a <13 account too (some bypasses might just tag) ❕
- This script only works in games that use the old chat as the new one doesn't have some things the old chat uses that are required to send the messages. ❗
